# Summary of App
The air quality in DC shiny app is a tool to demonstrate air quality and pollution in the city. Pulling data from Open Source Data DC on air pollution observations, as well as demographic data from {tidycensus}, users can choose what they would like to analyze. They pick one pollutant and one demographic and the app runs a linear model to see the relationship between the two data points. Then, a map of DC is also shown, filled with the demographic data and containing points where air pollution has been recorded.
